# Novaleaf-Core-Libraries 
*(project)*

## about
- this project stores all "helper" libraries we develop, 
- and all 3rd party libraries (preferably dev versions) we use during development

## how this is used ##

copy this project to a "core" folder in the project you wish to use it.   
It's best to do this every time you build (via a pre-build step) to 
auto-sync to the newest versions of this core-library.

### see the "knockback-basics" project for a good example.
